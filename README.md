  Hounsfield Units (HU) are a measurement used by radiologists to interpret computer tomography (CT) images. CT imaging is a noninvasive technique that uses X-rays to create detailed images of structures inside the body. HU values correspond to the density of different types of tissue in the human body, and can help radiologists differentiate between structures such as air, fat, muscle, and bone.

Interpreting CT images requires consideration of various anatomical, physiological, and pathophysiological factors in order to formulate an accurate diagnosis. HU values can be affected by factors such as the use of contrast agents, motion artifacts, and the specific CT imaging protocol used. Therefore, HU values are used in the diagnostic algorithm to guide towards the best medical result. It's important to interpret HU values in the context of the individual patient and clinical scenario to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

This program is for students, healthcare professionals or anyone interested in understanding the different HU values, as they are what determine the shades of grey on a CT and the coresponding structures.
